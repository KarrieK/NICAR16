# Csvkit and other command line tools

During this class we are going to look at how the python library csvkit can manipulate and analyse data

We are also going to cover curl and xxxx

#Overview
We are going to use the following commands

- in2csv
- csvlook
- csvcut
- csvclean
- csvstat
- csvsort
- csvgrep
- csvsql

#Installation
Ideally you will be running a virtualenv or virtualbox running a linux based operating system.
If not, never fear csvkit should operate fine on a Mac OS.
